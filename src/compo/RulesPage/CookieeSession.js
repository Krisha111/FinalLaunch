      <h1>Cookies Policy</h1>
      <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> June 17, 2025</p>

      <p>
        This Cookies Policy explains how and why cookies and similar technologies are used when you access or interact with our social media application. Understanding how cookies function and what role they play can help you make informed decisions about your privacy and preferences.
      </p>

      <h2>1. What Are Cookies?</h2>
      <p>
        Cookies are small data files that websites and apps store on your browser or device to remember information about you. They are essential tools that enable web platforms to recognize your device, improve your experience, and provide functionalities such as staying logged in or saving your preferences. Cookies are not programs‚Äîthey cannot carry viruses or install malware. They act as memory for the browser, helping the platform tailor its behavior to your actions.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Why We Use Cookies</h2>
      <p>
        Our application uses cookies to enhance user experience, personalize content, and ensure the platform functions smoothly. Without cookies, you would be asked to log in every time you open the app, and your interactions would not be saved across sessions. Cookies also allow us to detect issues, track app performance, and understand how different features are used. This enables us to improve navigation, fix bugs, and create features that align with user needs.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Types of Cookies We Use</h2>
      <p>
        We use a variety of cookies, each serving a specific purpose:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Essential Cookies:</strong> These are critical for basic functionalities, such as logging in, account verification, and securing user sessions. Without them, you wouldn‚Äôt be able to use key features of the app.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Preference Cookies:</strong> These remember your settings and preferences, such as your language, theme, or layout configuration. They allow the app to customize itself according to your choices each time you visit.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Performance and Analytics Cookies:</strong> These cookies help us understand how users interact with the platform. They provide aggregated data on page visits, feature use, and error reporting‚Äîwithout identifying individuals. This data is vital for optimizing usability and performance.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Third-party Cookies:</strong> We may work with external providers (e.g., Google Analytics, authentication services, content hosting) who set their own cookies to deliver specific services. These cookies are subject to the third-party‚Äôs own policies, not ours.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. How We Use Third-Party Cookies</h2>
      <p>
        In some cases, we integrate tools and services provided by trusted third parties. These services may place their own cookies on your device to analyze traffic, handle authentication, or deliver content. For example, we may use Google Analytics to better understand user behavior in aggregate form or CDN providers to load media faster. These third-party cookies are beyond our direct control and are governed by the providers' respective privacy policies. We encourage you to review their terms if you wish to understand how they manage cookie data.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Your Control Over Cookies</h2>
      <p>
        You are always in control of your cookie preferences. Most web browsers allow you to accept or reject cookies, delete them manually, or set rules for different websites. While you can disable cookies at any time through your browser settings, doing so may result in certain features of the app not working correctly. For example, disabling cookies may prevent automatic login or cause your preferences to be forgotten after each session.
      </p>
      <p>
        On your first visit, you may also see a cookie banner or pop-up where you can choose to accept all cookies, reject non-essential cookies, or customize your preferences. Your selections will be stored in your browser until you clear them.
      </p>

      <h2>6. How to Manage Cookies in Your Browser</h2>
      <p>
        Below are links to cookie management instructions for the most common browsers. You can use them to review, disable, or delete cookies:

      <h2>7. Future Use of Cookies</h2>
      <p>
        As we continue to develop and enhance our platform, we may introduce new cookies or update how we use existing ones to deliver improved services and personalization. When we do, we will revise this Cookies Policy and notify users if required by law. Any significant changes to how cookies function or are used will be clearly communicated.
